Protoclass
=========

#### Manifesto

Because *Human* is **perfectible** and **error-prone**, because *Science* should be **open** and **flow** and because *cogito ergo sum*.

Goal
----

This toolbox will aggregate some machine learning tools from all the walk of lives in order to fast prototype.

Installation
------------
Installation is only required for some of the toolbox in the thir_party
For those toolbox, follow the readme for each toolbox
Note: 
* RF_Class_C and RF_Class_R ---> change the mex path to your local mex path before compiling
